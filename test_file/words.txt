Whenever you need me， I'll be here。
Whenever you're in trouble， I'm always near。Whenever you feel alone，
and you think everyone has given up。。。
Reach out for me， and I will give you my everlasting love。

Her gesture， motion， and her smiles，Her wit，
her voice my heart beguiles，Beguiles my heart，
I know not why，And yet， I'll love her till I die。
Thomas Ford

If you were a teardrop，In my eye，For fear of losing you，
I would never cry。And if the golden sun，Should cease to shine its light，
Just one smile from you，Would make my whole world bright。
Hannah Jo Kee

When I wake up in the morning，You are all I see;
When I think about you，And how happy you make me。
You're everything I wanted;You're everything I need;
I look at you and know;That you are all to me。
Barry Fitzpatrick
